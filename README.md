## Enchanted Forest (Tandy Color Computer 3) (1982)
Fixed version of the one found on CoCo Archive - variables renamed, draw code repaired.
Or run the BASIC version directly on a CoCo 1 with no disk module (e.g. `xroar -m coco -no-machine-cart -run ENCHANT.BAS`)

## Flodnar (Tandy Color Computer 3) (1984)
OCR'd from the Second Rainbow Book of Adventures, previously unavailable, this is the second tape required to play Kragnor/Flodnar.
BASIC source included.

## Grave Robbers (VIC-20) (1982)
All the copies I could find of this on the internet are broken in some way (either the second part crashes, or is a duplicate of the first part). This one works, but needs an extra 3KB of RAM.

## Gross/2 (OS/2) (1995)
A Windows version of the OS/2 [adventure game of the same name](https://www.os2world.com/games/index.php/native-games/adventure/94-gross-2).

## Icarus - For Lost Phenix (PC-88) (1983)
Discovered on a compilation disk.

## Stormbringer (Apple II) (1984)
Discovered as source code and compiled in Apple II Pascal.

## Stowaway (Tandy Color Computer 3) (1984)
OCR'd from the Second Rainbow Book of Adventures, previously unavailable. Use PCLEAR1 before CLOAD to free up enough memory.
